# select-an-element-with-jQuery-that-does-not-have-a-specific-class-name
To select an element with jQuery that does not have a specific class name, you can use the :not() selector combined with the class selector.

Here's an example that selects all <div> elements that do not have the class "example":

```
$("div:not(.example)")
```
This will return a jQuery object containing all <div> elements on the page that do not have the class "example". You can replace "div" with any other selector to target different types of elements.

You can also use the not() method to achieve the same result:

```
$("div").not(".example")
```
This code will also select all <div> elements that do not have the class "example".
